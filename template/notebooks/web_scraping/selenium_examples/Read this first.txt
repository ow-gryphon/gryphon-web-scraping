These examples were made in 2018, and the Selenium methods/functions have changed slightly since then, so the code is currently broken (unless an old version of Selenium is used).
If you attempt to use this code and get errors, it should be easy to google them to find the new syntax

These were the version numbers for these examples:
numpy==1.15.1
pandas==0.23.4
python-dateutil==2.7.3
pytz==2018.5
selenium==3.14.0
six==1.11.0
urllib3==1.23
